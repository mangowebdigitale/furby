              An anonymous reader writes: There's been a huge push over the last few years to make programming part of the core academic curriculum. Hype or not, software developer Al Sweigart takes a shot at predicting what this will be in a future where some degree of coding skill is commonplace and he has an interesting take on it: "More programmers doesn't just mean more apps in app stores or clones of existing websites. Universal coding literacy doesn't increase the supply of web services so much as increase the sophistication in how web services are used. Programming—by which I mean being able to direct a computer to access data, organize it, and then make decisions based on it— will open up not only a popular ability to make more of online services, but also to demand more. Almost every major website has an Application Program Interface (API), a formal specification for software to retrieve data and make requests similar to human-directed browsers. ... The vast majority of users don't use these APIs—or even know what an API is—because programming is something that they've left to the professionals. But when coding becomes universal, so will the expectation that websites become accessible to more than just browsers."<p></p><div class="share_submission">

              mikejuk writes: Programmers Day comes around every year and yet each year it seems to be increasingly ignored. Why, when we are trying to encourage children to take up all things computing, is Programmers Day such a big flop? If you've not encountered it before, the idea is that on a specific day we celebrate computer programmers. It is designated to be on the 256th day of the year, which in most years is September 13th and this year, 2015, it falls on a Sunday. If you don't know why it's the 256th day, then you probably aren't a programmer and there is no point in explaining. The usual suggestions for things to do on programmer day include telling jokes and other fairly lame stuff. How about instead: Teach someone to program just a little bit.<p></p><div class="share_submission">

              New submitter alphamore writes: Live Coding, which is like Twitch for developers, has added a service that allows viewers to actually hire someone they've been watching. The aptly named 'Hire a streamer' service works exactly as it sounds. Via the profile of a developer you've seen coding on the site, a 'hire me' button lets you request their time. The service is completely opt-in for developers, so not everyone will be for-hire. When you click on the 'hire me' button, you'll be met with a list of disciplines that developer is familiar with, and their hourly rate. Once you've booked a session, the money is held in escrow (transactions happen via the site) until the developer has completed the work.<p></p><div class="share_submission">

              You can't teach all programming by using Minecraft to keep kids interested, but you can use Minecraft, Java, and Eclipse to give them a good start. That's what Tyler Kilgore and his colleagues at GameStart are doing. Watch today's video (number 1), tomorrow's video (number 2) and read both days' transcripts for the full scoop. EDIT: "Tomorrow's video" should read, "Monday's video."<p></p><div class="share_submission">

              HughPickens.com writes: Lauren O'Neil writes at CBC News that internet companies "across China" are hiring "pretty, talented girls that help create a fun work environment." Dubbed "programming cheerleaders," these young women serve to chit-chat, play Ping-Pong with employees as part of their role, and sometimes smile and clap for male employees who play guitar in the office, as indicated by photos posted to the news service's verified "Trending in China" Facebook page. "According to the HR manager of an Internet company that hired three such cheerleaders, its programmers are mostly male and terrible at socializing," reads China.org.cn's Facebook post. "The presence of these girls have greatly improved their job efficiency and motivation." 

However people from all over the world have weighed in to decry the reported role. "This is degrading — both to the 'cheerleaders' and the programmers," wrote one commenter on the original post. "Look at the face of the poor woman programmer in the second picture. Stereotypical 'bro' culture only now with Chinese subtitles." Others suggest that the company pictured should simply hire more female programmers. "What a ridiculous job, why reduce women to only be valued by their looks and to assist males. Let them have a job at the desk using their minds!" wrote one woman.<p></p><div class="share_submission">

              Nerval's Lobster writes: Not too long ago, a Forbes writer declared that a liberal arts degree had "become tech's hottest ticket." At so-called 'disruptive juggernauts' such as Facebook and Uber, George Anders wrote, 'the war for talent' had moved into non-technical realms such as marketing and sales. While there's undoubtedly some truth to Anders's thesis, technology recruiters and executives aren't seeing any less demand for strong technical skills in a wide variety of roles (Dice link). When there's a need for tech professionals with 'soft skills,' at least one recruiter just recruits computer-science majors from liberal arts schools, figuring those recruits will be more 'well-rounded.' To be clear, Forbes doesn't suggest that IT employers have begun mixing liberal-arts graduates into their technical teams; the article talks more about those graduates ending up in supporting roles such as sales and marketing, or else becoming intermediaries who translate the customer's product requirements into engineering solutions. But nobody should think that a strong technical background isn't as valued as ever throughout tech companies.<p></p><div class="share_submission">

              Nerval's Lobster writes: Which tech segment added the most jobs in August? According to new data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, tech consulting gained 7,000 positions in August, (Dice link) below July's gains of 11,100, but enough to set it ahead of data processing, hosting, and related services (which added 1,600 jobs) and computer and electronic-product manufacturing (which lost 1,800 jobs). The latest numbers reflect some longtime trends: The rise of cloud services and infrastructure has contributed to slackening demand for PCs and other hardware, eroding manufacturing jobs. At the same time, increased appetite for everything from Web developers to information-systems managers has kept employers adding positions in other technology segments. If that didn't make things difficult enough for manufacturing folks, the rise of automation has cut down on the number of manufacturing jobs available worldwide, contributing to continuing pressure on the segment as a whole, despite all the noise about bringing those jobs back to the U.S.<p></p><div class="share_submission">

              An anonymous reader writes: The Free Software Foundation was founded in 1985. To paint a picture of what computing was like back then, the Amiga 1000 was released, C++ was becoming a dominant language, Aldus PageMaker was announced, and networking was just starting to grow. Oh, and that year Careless Whisper by Wham! was a major hit. Things have changed a lot in 30 years. Back in 1985 the FSF was primarily focused on building free pieces of software that were primarily useful to nerdy computer people. These days we have software, services, social networks, and more to consider. In this in-depth interview, FSF executive director John Sullivan discusses the most prominent risks to software freedom today, Richard M. Stallman, and more.<p></p><div class="share_submission">

              theodp writes: The Waterloo Cedar Falls Courier reports that Ben Schafer, an associate CS prof at the Univ. of Northern Iowa, was recognized at Code.org's annual summit for training 570 K-12 teachers in Iowa, which is equivalent to 5.5 percent of all U.S. teachers trained. Schafer ranked No. 2 in the '500 Club', a Code.org affiliate of trainers who trained more than 500 teachers in the first year of the program. Code.org's K-5 Affiliates "deliver one-day, in-person workshops to local elementary school teachers to teach computer science in a format that's fun and accessible". A Term Sheet explains to potential Affiliates that "Code.org will pay you $50 per workshop-attendee to cover costs, including food, and to compensate you and any teaching assistants." According to a White House' Fact Sheet, Code.org plans to use $20 million in philanthropic funds to train 10,000 teachers by fall 2015 and 25,000 teachers by fall 2016.

Benchmarks of PHP 7.0 RC2 show that these performance claims are indeed accurate, and just not for popular PHP programs like WordPress. In tests done by Phoronix, the PHP performance was 2~2.5x faster all while consuming less memory than PHP 5.3~5.6. Facebook's HHVM implementation meanwhile still held a small performance lead, though it was consuming much more memory. PHP 7.0 is scheduled to be released in November.<p></p><div class="share_submission">

              esarjeant writes: For many Java developers, IntelliJ has been our predominant IDE. JetBrains is looking to make their tools easier easier to buy and use by switching to a subscription program. Their plan is to have people pay a monthly/yearly fee for access to the tools instead of upgrading when they're ready. Fortunately, if your subscription lapses it looks like you'll have 30 days to check all your stuff in. How does NetBeans look now?
Many members of various developer communities are pushing back against this change: "For a developer with an unstable income, it might be perfectly fine to stay on an older version of the software until they've stashed enough cash to afford the upgrade. That will no longer work." JetBrains has acknowledged the feedback, and say they will act on it.<p></p><div class="share_submission">

              An anonymous reader writes: Game developers frequently turn to procedural algorithms to generate some of their game's content. Sometimes it's to give the game more diverse environments, or to keep things fresh upon subsequent playthroughs, or simply just to save precious development time. If you've played a game that had an unpredictable layout of connected rooms, you may have wondered how it was built. No longer; a post at Gamasutra walks through a procedural generation algorithm, showing how random and unique layouts can be created with some clever code. The article is filled with animated pictures demonstrating how rooms pop into existence, spread themselves out to prevent overlap, finds a sensible series of connections, and then fill in the gaps with doors and hallways.<p></p><div class="share_submission">

Unfortunately, they're running into a serious problem: one-third of the secondary schools tasked with teaching these programs have not spent any money training their teachers on the requisite knowledge and technology. The government has provided £4.5 million for this training, and a number of schools have spent their share and more.

  <a href="//what-if.xkcd.com/139/"><h1>Jupiter Descending</h1></a>
  <p id="question">If you did <a href="http://what-if.xkcd.com/138/">fall into Jupiter's atmosphere in a submarine</a>, what would it actually look like? What would you see before you melted or burned up?</p>
<p id="attribute">—Ada Munroe</p>
<p>We don't know! We've only flown spacecraft into a gas planet's atmosphere twice (both Jupiter). One had no cameras, and one went in at night (and was being disposed of, so wasn't taking pictures anyway).</p>
<p>If you took a submarine to Jupiter, it would burn up. Jupiter has a deep gravity well; after falling down toward it from space, you're going very fast. There's no easy way to shed that speed other than slamming into the atmosphere and letting it slow you down, but the entry is about four times faster than the Space Shuttle or Apollo Earth reentries. Only the Galileo probe has survived a Jupiter atmospheric entry.</p>
<img class="illustration" title="The Galileo spacecraft which launched the probe later did the same thing, but without the heat shield." src="/imgs/a/139/galileo.png">
<p>The Galileo probe survived by being a bullet with a big heat shield, and several inches of the shield were burned away before it finished slowing down and started falling vertically by parachute. The probe only sent back about half a megabyte of data to the Galileo orbiter, and had no camera, so we don't know what it saw.</p>
<p>We could, I guess, try to do the same thing with a submarine—by mounting a giant heat shield on the front—but it would probably qualify as the <a href="https://youtu.be/vwrLR2kv5KA?t=1119">most Kerbal</a> vehicle ever built.</p>
<img class="illustration" title="This would probably need a LOT more struts." src="/imgs/a/139/ksp.png">
<p>If our submarine survived, what would we see?<span class="ref"><span class="refnum">[1]</span><span class="refbody">I mean, submarines don't usually have a lot of windows, but we at least have a periscope, right?</span></span></p>
<p>The best pictures we have of Jupiter's atmosphere are probably <a href="http://www.planetary.org/blogs/emily-lakdawalla/2010/2644.html">these carefully processed mosaics</a> of the Great Red Spot, but they're still taken from very far away. At those resolutions, a huge Earth thunderstorm would appear as roughly one pixel. Trying to figure out what Jupiter's clouds would look like from those pictures is like using <a href="http://visibleearth.nasa.gov/view.php?id=78314">this</a> to reconstruct <a href="http://stormandsky.smugmug.com/Thumbnail-Galleries">these</a>.</p>
<p>By combining the pictures with other science data, we've been able to put together a pretty good idea of what Jupiter's atmosphere is like, but there are some pretty big questions still unanswered which make it hard to be too confident about what it would actually look like. For example, you know the Great Red Spot? We don't know what all that red stuff is.</p>
<img class="illustration" title="Yup!" src="/imgs/a/139/really.png">
<p>Author Michael Carroll has done a lot of thinking about planetary atmospheres, and his book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Drifting-Alien-Winds-Exploring-Weather/dp/1441969160">Drifting on Alien Winds</a> vividly describes of what it would be like to descend through Jupiter's clouds. He was also kind enough to answer some of my questions about Jupiter. Here's a rough sketch of what you'd see as you descended through the clouds; for more, definitely <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Drifting-Alien-Winds-Exploring-Weather/dp/1441969160">check out his book</a>.</p>
<img class="illustration" title="Galileo's data disproved the seven-layer model for Jupiter's envelope." src="/imgs/a/139/layers.png">
<p>Jupiter's upper atmosphere (the part we would see before we <a href="http://what-if.xkcd.com/138/">died</a>) has three main layers—an upper layer of haze and ammonia clouds, similar to <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=cirrostratus&amp;tbm=isch">cirrostratus</a> clouds on Earth. Below that is a thick, reddish-brown ammonium hydrosulfide cloud layer. The lowest layer consists of white water clouds, which occasionally rise into towering thunderstorms that occasionally push through the middle layer.</p>
<p>Between these cloud layers, the air is probably pretty clear. At those levels, it would be less dense than the air on Earth, so you could see a long way. Thanks to <a href="https://xkcd.com/1145/">Rayleigh scattering</a>, the sky would be blue, and objects far off in the distance would fade to blue just like <a href="http://thehelpfulartteacher.blogspot.com/2010/11/landscapes-continuedatmospheric.html">they do on Earth</a>. But since Jupiter is so huge, we might not see the clouds disappear over the horizon; the towers might just fade off into the distance.</p>
<p>We don't really know how accurate these pictures are, though, until we send a camera to fly down into Jupiter's atmosphere and send pictures back.</p>
<p>Juno, scheduled to reach Jupiter next year, carries <a href="http://www.msss.com/all_projects/junocam.php">a pretty nice camera</a>,<span class="ref"><span class="refnum">[2]</span><span class="refbody">Thank you to Emily Lakdawalla for her helpful background about various spacecraft cameras, including her many thorough spreadsheets.</span></span> which should give us slightly better-resolution pictures, but it still won't really give us a sense of what the cloud decks look like from within them. For that, we need to send in a probe with a camera—and there's nothing like that on the horizon. There's certainly more science value in visiting Europa than in satisfying our curiosity about the Jovian sky.</p>
<p>But with <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/directorates/spacetech/niac/staehle_interplanetary_cubesats.html">interplanetary cubesats</a> soon to make their debut, who knows—maybe someone out there will put together a camera, heat shield, and parachute, and hitch a ride on the next outer planets mission. And then, finally, we'll get to look at Jupiter's clouds <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9j_j-cUwKc">from both sides</a>.</p>

  <a href="//what-if.xkcd.com/138/"><h1>Jupiter Submarine</h1></a>
  <p id="question">What if you released a submarine into Jupiter's atmosphere? Would it eventually reach a point where it would float? Could it navigate?</p>
<p id="attribute">—KTH</p>
<p>Nope! Jupiter's pressure, density, and temperature curves are different from ours. At the point in Jupiter's atmosphere where the density is high enough for a submarine to float, the pressure is high enough to crush the submarine,<span class="ref"><span class="refnum">[1]</span><span class="refbody">Which makes it more dense.</span></span> and the temperature is high enough to melt it.<span class="ref"><span class="refnum">[2]</span><span class="refbody">Which makes it harder to drive. </span></span></p>
<img class="illustration" title="Phase diagram courtesy a very hardcore unauthorized edition of the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics." src="/imgs/a/138/phase.png">
<p>But there's another problem: Jupiter is a gas giant, but submarines—as you can figure out from etymology—go under water.</p>
<img class="illustration" title="Second-horse capabilities dramatically changed the global geopolitical strategic balance vis-a-vis horses." src="/imgs/a/138/etym.png">
<p>Air and water are different. This seems straightforward enough, but they're also the same in a lot of ways. They're both "fluids," and some of the same rules apply to each. In some sense, when you <a href="http://xkcd.com/1556/">look up at the sky</a>, you're looking up from the bottom of a deep sea of air.</p>
<p>Things float when they're less dense than the fluid around them. This works the same for balloons in air and boats in water. The late Terry Pratchett wrote a truly beautiful passage about this, in the prologue to his book <em>Going Postal</em>. He says that since water is in many respects a wetter form of air,<span class="ref"><span class="refnum">[3]</span><span class="refbody">Sounds reasonable enough to me.</span></span> as ships sink, eventually they reach a point where the water was too dense to sink any further. This layer forms an underwater surface on which shipwrecks collect, drifting around beneath the waves but far above the sea floor:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s calm there. Dead calm.</p>
<p>Some stricken ships have rigging; some even have sails. Many still have crew, tangled in the rigging or lashed to the wheel.</p>
<p>But the voyages still continue, aimlessly, with no harbour in sight, because there are currents under the ocean and so the dead ships with their skeleton crews sail on around the world, over sunken cities and between drowned mountains, until rot and shipworms eat them away and they disintegrate.</p>
<p>Sometimes an anchor drops, all the way to the dark, cold calmness of the abyssal plain, and disturbs the stillness of centuries by throwing up a cloud of silt.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I love that passage. It's also <strong>completely wrong</strong>. Ships sink all the way to the bottom. (Sir Terry knew this, as the rest of the passage makes clear, but he's describing how ships work on Discworld, not Earth.)</p>
<p>Air follows the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideal_gas_law">ideal gas law</a>. The more pressure you put on it, the smaller (and denser) it gets.</p>
<p>Water, on the other hand, is pretty much incompressible. When you dive into the ocean, the pressure increases as you go deeper (rising by one atmosphere every 10 meters or so) but the water's density barely changes all the way down to the sea floor.</p>
<p>Buoyancy depends on density, not pressure. There's a point in Jupiter's atmosphere where the pressure is equal to a little more than an Earth atmosphere—which is the pressure a submarine is used to—but the air there is barely a tenth as dense as ours. A submarine in that layer would fall even faster than it would in the air on Earth.</p>
<img class="illustration" title="Not sure what's going on, but you should probably fasten your seatbelts, assuming these things have seatbelts." src="/imgs/a/138/falling.png">
<p>To reach a depth where it could "float" in Jupiter, the submarine would have to go halfway to the center of the planet, where the intense pressure turns the air into a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metallic_hydrogen">metallic soup</a> that's hotter than the surface of the Sun. The pressure there would be so high that not only would the submarine be crushed, the substances that make it up would probably be converted into new and exciting forms. It's hard to create those kinds of conditions in a lab, so we don't know a lot about how materials behave with that much pressure pushing down on them.</p>
<img class="illustration" title="-&gt; Can't Touch This" src="/imgs/a/138/bowie.png">
<p>In the sea, on the other hand, the density of the fluid stays relatively constant. That means the submarine can find its appropriate pressure range and float there. In other words, submarines only work because water doesn't follow the ideal gas law.</p>
<p>But there's one more twist: Water sort of <em>does</em> obey the ideal gas law. The equations governing water under normal pressure <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1311.0534.pdf">are similar to</a> the equation for a gas under about twenty thousand atmospheres of pressure. In a sense, this is why water seems incompressible to us—it behaves as if it's already compressed so much that an extra atmosphere or two hardly makes a difference.</p>
<p>So, in some ways, water and air are more similar than they seem, but in the ways that matter for a submarine, they really <em>are</em> different.</p>
<p>Which, of course, brings us back to why it's called a submarine—it operates under a "mare". A vehicle designed to operate beneath a sea of air would be called a subaerine.<span class="ref"><span class="refnum">[5]</span><span class="refbody">The "gas" in "gas giant" is from the Greek word for void (χάος, kháos), so maybe a vessel (σκάφη, skáphē) that travels through a gas giant's atmosphere would be a khaoskaphe.</span></span></p>
<p>Which, come to think of it, is a perfectly good description of a car.</p>

  <a href="//what-if.xkcd.com/137/"><h1>New Horizons</h1></a>
  <p id="question">What if New Horizons hits my car?</p>
<p id="attribute">—Robin Sheat</p>
<p>The <em>New Horizons</em> spacecraft is currently flying past Pluto.<span class="ref"><span class="refnum">[1]</span><span class="refbody">Ever since astrophysicist Katie Mack <a href="https://twitter.com/AstroKatie/status/620693000381952000">pointed out</a> that "New Horizons" appears in the lyrics to <em>A Whole New World</em>, I've gotten it stuck in my head every time I've seen something about Pluto. </span></span> For the last few days, it's been giving us our first clear look at the world, and it should be making its closest approach at the moment this article is posted. Either that, or hitting your car, I guess.</p>
<img class="illustration" title="STATUS: NEW HORIZONS HAS, AT LAST, CAUGHT AND DESTROYED PLUTO." src="/imgs/a/137/status.png">
<p>It's hard to imagine how that could happen, even if <em>New Horizons</em> had <a href="http://xkcd.com/1532/">headed to Earth by mistake</a>. Unless there's been an especially strange freeway accident, your car is currently within the Earth's atmosphere. All that air stops spacecraft from flying into the ground at full speed. But maybe you took a wrong turn and ended up near Charon, or maybe you drove into a freak <em>extremely</em>-low-pressure system, leaving no atmosphere above you. It could happen!​<span class="ref"><span class="refnum">[2]</span><span class="refbody">It really, really couldn't.</span></span></p>
<p><em>New Horizons</em> is about the size and weight of a grand piano, and is currently screaming along at about 14 kilometers per second. If it hit your car, it would be pretty bad for both vehicles.</p>
<p>How fast is 14 kilometers per second? Here's my favorite comparison for putting that speed in perspective: If you were standing at one end of a football field and fired a gun toward the other end, right while <em>New Horizons</em> flew past you, the spacecraft would reach the far end zone before the bullet made it to the 10-yard line.<span class="ref"><span class="refnum">[3]</span><span class="refbody">In that same amount of time, a speeding car would travel about an inch.</span></span></p>
<img class="illustration" title="While this play isn't legal in American football, it's permitted in rugby." src="/imgs/a/137/football.png">
<p>This high speed means that by this afternoon, <em>New Horizons</em> will be on its way out of the Pluto system,<span class="ref"><span class="refnum">[4]</span><span class="refbody">People often ask why <em>New Horizons</em> is just doing a flyby, and not sticking around to orbit Pluto. The answer is: If you can figure out a way to do that, go for it. Pluto is really far away, and to get a probe there before your career ends, you have to go really fast. When you're going that fast, it's <a href="http://what-if.xkcd.com/38/">hard to stop</a>. (At least, if you want to stop in one piece.) </span></span> and over the coming days and weeks it will let us know what it saw today. It can't talk to Earth and take photos at the same time, so right now it's spending all its time taking pictures and gathering data.</p>
<p>Later today, the spacecraft will pause the data-gathering for a moment to send a brief message to Earth. No results—just, "Hey, I'm still alive". If it <em>is</em> still alive, that is. It's flying at terrifying speed through a part of the Solar System we've never visited. There could be, say, a bunch of small rocks there.<span class="ref"><span class="refnum">[5]</span><span class="refbody">In case of disaster, <em>New Horizons</em> has sent back a few snapshots and data dumps right before the encounter, so at least we'll have those.</span></span> Or a car.</p>
<img class="illustration" title="Not for navigational use." src="/imgs/a/137/herebecars.png">
<p><em>New Horizons</em> will send the "I'm okay" message in the afternoon, but it takes light four and a half hours to get back to Earth, so it will get here around 8:53pm Eastern US time—so if you're going to have a Pluto party, that's the time to do it. You can tune in to <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/nasatv/">NASA TV</a> to watch the nervous people in mission control wait for the signal. You'll know it worked if there's lots of cheering and hugging.</p>
<p>For more details on the mission, check out Emily Lakdawalla's comprehensive Planetary Society post, <a href="http://www.planetary.org/blogs/emily-lakdawalla/2015/06240556-what-to-expect-new-horizons-pluto.html">What to expect when you're expecting a flyby</a>, which has dates, times, and background on all the equipment. (For up-to-the-minute coverage, <a href="https://twitter.com/elakdawalla">her Twitter feed</a> is probably the best place to go for updates, context, and excitement.)</p>
<p>So what does all this mean for your car?</p>
<p>Passenger cars have "crumple zones," which are areas of the car designed to fold up and absorb some of the force of an impact before it reaches the passenger cabin. Unfortunately, in a hypervelocity impact, materials like metal aren't nearly strong enough to hold together. Instead of crumpling, they <a href="http://www.esa.int/var/esa/storage/images/esa_multimedia/images/2013/hypervelocity_impact/12635239-1-eng-GB/Hypervelocity_Impact.png">splash</a>. New Horizons and your car's crumple zone would splash as bits of them passed through each other, and the resulting spray of metal would do the same to the rest of your car. From a distance, it would probably look approximately like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWZcT-kr-_o">this</a>.</p>
<p>Here's the good news: NASA will have to pay for your car. Under the <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/iasl/research/space-law/liability-convention">Convention on the International Liability for Damage Caused by Space Object</a>, NASA and the US government would clearly be on the hook for the damage. And, since you wouldn't be considered at fault in the accident, in most states insurance companies would be legally prohibited from raising your premiums.</p>
<p>The situation would be slightly complicated by the fact that this would be a <strong>nuclear</strong> accident. <em>New Horizons</em> flies too far from the Sun to use solar panels, so it's powered by the heat from a bunch of lumps of plutonium-238. The container holding the plutonium is sturdy, since it's <a href="http://www.osti.gov/accomplishments/documents/fullText/ACC0167.pdf">designed</a> to survive atmospheric reentry (and has <a href="http://www.universetoday.com/120124/13-more-things-that-saved-apollo-13-part-13-jim-lovells-90-degree-wrong-turn/">done so</a>). However, it's <em>not</em> designed to survive entry into a Chevy. The container and the plutonium inside it would be splattered across the landscape. The US government will not only have to replace your car, it will probably have to replace much of your neighborhood.</p>
<p>This has actually happened before. In 1978, the Soviet satellite Kosmos 954, which carried a nuclear reactor, reentered the atmosphere and disintegrated over Canada. The Canadian government spent millions cleaning up the radioactive debris near Yellowknife. They demanded over $6 million (CAD) from the Soviets for the cleanup, and were <a href="http://www.jaxa.jp/library/space_law/chapter_3/3-2-2-1_e.html">eventually paid</a> $3 million.</p>
<p>Hopefully, <em>New Horizons</em> is currently flying past Pluto. But don't worry; if it somehow hits your car instead, the US government will cover things. To find out which one it is—Pluto or your car—tune in to <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/nasatv/">NASA TV</a>.</p>

              <p>After many repeated requests (which was kind of surprising), here is my overview of the 2014 anime I watched.  I am told that I was too negative in previous lists and I want to avoid that this time…  probably not going to happen!</p>
<p>This year had a LOT of sequels. I prefer to watch something new unless the original was outstanding, so I ignored some of these (how can Fate/Stay have so many spin-offs?). And for some reason, many ~22 episode series were split in half and had a break in the middle.  I am counting those as one series.  Speaking of both sequels and split anime…</p>

<p style="text-align: center; padding-top: 1.5em;"><img src="http://allanmcrae.com/images/anime-2014/mushi-shi-next-passage.png"></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Mushi-Shi: Next Passage</em></strong><br>(TV Series, 11+10 episodes + special)</p>
<p>This is how you do a sequel! And it came out of nowhere about 10 years after the original.  The stunning visuals remain and are improved on as we expect in the HD era. The atmospheric soundtrack sits very well with the stories, with the intro “Shiver” by Lucy Rose fitting in perfectly. As with the original series, the story is largely episodic but there is a subtle underlying flow brings it together.  Not only do I consider this the anime of 2014, it would be a strong contender for anime of the year in any year. Look out for the movie in 2015.</p>

<p style="text-align: center; padding-top: 1.5em;"><img src="http://allanmcrae.com/images/anime-2014/kill-la-kill.png"></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Kill la Kill</em></strong><br>(TV Series, 24 episodes)</p>
<p>Half naked girls fighting while being manipulated by clothing…  This is made by the same people as “Gurren Lagann”, and it is just as insane, just with less robots and more fan-service.  And there is a lot of fan-service, to the point where it would have been awkward if I watched this when taking public transport to work! That also caused some controversy around the internet. I watched this for the craziness and enjoyed it for that – the fan-service seemed to fit in to that insanity. This is not an anime that needs watched with extensive thought. (The uproar about the nudity makes it awkward to justify enjoying this series.  But I am sure that if I only wanted to see naked people, I could just find some somewhere in the dark recesses of the internet…)</p>
<p style="text-align: center; padding-top: 1.5em;"><img src="http://allanmcrae.com/images/anime-2014/ping-pong-the-animation.png"></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Ping Pong the Animation</em></strong><br>(TV Series, 11 episodes)</p>
<p>I only watched this after it being repeatedly recommended to me, because I do not enjoy sport anime.  It turns out, Ping Pong is not really a sport anime… despite being about ping pong.  This is a show about the growth of the main characters, their friendships and rivalries develop while revolving around the game.  Saying that, I saw some ping pong on TV the other day and I was now an expert on it, so there was some sport there.  I found the distinctive art style aided in skimming over the actual games without losing the main focus of the show.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; padding-top: 1.5em;"><img src="http://allanmcrae.com/images/anime-2014/samurai-flamenco.png"></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Samurai Flamenco</em></strong><br>(TV Series,  22 episodes)</p>
<p>This is a series that people I have talked to either love or hate.  I think it is because the series starts out reasonably serious and realistic before going off on wild tangents. I am still not sure if the script was planned, or if the writers genuinely went crazy (although I may lean towards planned after completing the series).  But you can not go past this if you want a fun superhero story that has the ability to go from low-tech and gritty to the other extreme.  I watch anime for fun, and not to search for some higher meaning, so this was a close contender for anime of the year!</p>
<p style="text-align: center; padding-top: 1.5em;"><img src="http://allanmcrae.com/images/anime-2014/silver-spoon-2.png"></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Silver Spoon 2</em></strong><br>(TV Series, 11 episodes)</p>
<p>Much like my comments on the first series, there is nothing individually outstanding about the sequel.  It is just consistently good.  The second season does well in moving on from the issues dealt with during the first (far less “this is where my food comes from” jokes) and focusing on new challenges.  You know, exactly what a good sequel should do…</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Average</h3>
<p style="text-align: center; padding-top: 1.5em;"><img src="http://allanmcrae.com/images/anime-2014/akame-ga-kill.png"></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Akame ga Kill!</em></strong><br>(TV Series,  24 episodes)</p>
<p>This was one hyped anime for some reason. But there was nothing outstanding in it (some would call it “average” even…). The animation and music during the action sequences was well done, and that makes this fun to watch. However, it goes from dramatic battle to light-hearted romp with the flick of a switch, which ruins both.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; padding-top: 1.5em;"><img src="http://allanmcrae.com/images/anime-2014/ghost-in-the-shell-arise.png"></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Ghost in the Shell: Arise</em></strong><br>(OVA, 4 episodes)</p>
<p>Sort of a prequel to Stand Alone Complex, but the backstories have changed… so not a prequel.  But there is enough familiarity with the characters that it feels like a prequel (is any of this making sense?).  The result is something neither better or worse than the original series.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; padding-top: 1.5em;"><img src="http://allanmcrae.com/images/anime-2014/psycho-pass-2.png"></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Psycho Pass 2</em></strong><br>(TV Series, 11 episodes)</p>
<p>Not how to do a sequel! I really enjoyed the darkness and mystery of the first series, but that had been mostly resolved and that left not a lot to add. The sequel proceeded to add that not a lot (or even just blatantly rip-off ideas from the first series), resulting in something that was both mildly entertaining and unnecessary at the same time.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; padding-top: 1.5em;"><img src="http://allanmcrae.com/images/anime-2014/space-brothers.png"></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Space Brothers</em></strong><br>(TV Series,  99 episodes)</p>
<p>I usually check how many episodes a series has before I start watching it – I forgot for this one! Saying that, I watched each episode of this immediately as it broadcast. I would say this is highly recommended apart from the episodes being a bit slow at times and a bit predictable.  Also, there was a trend to a substantial recap at the start of episodes.  If they fixed that by reducing the series by ~20 episodes, this would be a great(er) anime.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; padding-top: 1.5em;"><img src="http://allanmcrae.com/images/anime-2014/space-dandy.png"></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Space Dandy</em></strong><br>(TV Series, 13+13 episodes)</p>
<p>After picking a cow for Silver Spoon, I knew what picture I needed here too!  I had great hope for this anime – it is by the makers of some of my favourites.  However… I never got caught up in this series.  Everything about it is simple, right down to the “comedy” which has none of the unexpected surprise needed to be funny. For example the “Boobies” restaurant, which is Hooters in space – oh, it is also shaped like boobs.  That is the joke… There is also nothing riding on the outcome of an episode (spoiler follows). The entire cast die at the end of the first episode and are back as if nothing happened in episode two.  So who cares what happens?</p>
<p style="text-align: center; padding-top: 1.5em;"><img src="http://allanmcrae.com/images/anime-2014/tiger-and-bunny-the-movie-the-rising.png"></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Tiger and Bunny the Movie: The Rising</em></strong><br>(Movie, 100 minutes)</p>
<p>The second part of a two movie series that may or may not be a recap of the TV series (I can not be bothered checking…).  If they were not a recap, it added very little beyond what the TV series did in terms of actual development of the storyline.  Still enjoyable.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; padding-top: 1.5em;"><img src="http://allanmcrae.com/images/anime-2014/tokyo-ghoul.png"></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Tokyo Ghoul</em></strong><br>(TV Series,  12 episodes)</p>
<p>I usually like short series (good risk/reward investment ratio), but I think being too short was the failure here.  There was character development, building a world where ghouls have their own society, and then someone asked “how many episodes do we have left?”.  Queue the final three episodes being packed with action and not a lot else.  I realize there is a second series, but why would you watch it after what they did to the first?</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Sub-par</h3>
<p style="text-align: center; padding-top: 1.5em;"><img src="http://allanmcrae.com/images/anime-2014/a-certain-magical-index-the-movie-the-miracle-of-endymion.png"></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>A Certain Magical Index The Movie: The Miracle of Endymion</em></strong><br>(Movie, 90 minutes)</p>
<p>This was the final straw in me watching “A Certain …” series.  I really liked the first Scientific Railgun series (I think everyday superpowers is still a great concept), but this took much of what I did not enjoy about that series and added it to Magical Index (which was never as good), and come up with something that I really did not enjoy. Maybe this will serve as a reminder to me and I will not watch the next one (maybe).</p>
<p style="text-align: center; padding-top: 1.5em;"><img src="http://allanmcrae.com/images/anime-2014/hozuki-no-reitetsu.png"></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Hozuki no Reitetsu</em></strong><br>(TV Series, 13 episodes)</p>
<p>A slice-of-life anime set in Japanese Hell.  It gets some points for being fairly original… However, I found the jokes fell flat more often than not, and that can leave a big gap when there is nothing else going on.  With two stories per show (that is 10 minutes a plot line), nothing really caught my interest and I took a long time to finish watching this.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; padding-top: 1.5em;"><img src="http://allanmcrae.com/images/anime-2014/log-horizon.png"></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Log Horizon</em></strong><br>(TV Series, 25 episodes)</p>
<p>Another “stuck in a game” anime, with the twist that there seems to be the lack of motivation to leave.  Too much filler (especially near the end), forgettable action scenes, and a storyline that resembled a poor version of Spice and Wolf.  The most entertained I was in this series was when other people started mocking the main character for always touching his glasses…</p>
<p style="text-align: center; padding-top: 1.5em;"><img src="http://allanmcrae.com/images/anime-2014/noragami.png"></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Noragami</em></strong><br>(TV Series, 12 episodes)</p>
<p>I think this series was not particular bad in itself, but I think it could have been good and failed.  I am still not sure what it was missing, but I find the whole thing completely forgettable (which may be why this “review” is so vague).</p>
<p style="text-align: center; padding-top: 1.5em;"><img src="http://allanmcrae.com/images/anime-2014/terror-in-resonance.png"></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Terror in Resonance (Zankyou no Terror)</em></strong><br>(TV Series, 11 episodes)</p>
<p>The initial build-up is OK – good even – but everything becomes overly contrived in the second half. Overall, this is probably a reasonable watch if you are not hoping for greatness, but I rate those series that screw up their potential harshly.  And I just noticed the director was Shinichiro Watanabe, who has been involved in many of my favourite series. He did not have a great year according to this blog post!</p>

              <p>Recently, Arch Linux updated to <tt>gcc-5.1</tt>.  This brought a lot of new <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-5/changes.html">features</a>, but the one that I am focusing on today is the new C++ ABI that appears when the compiler is built using default option.</p>
<p>Supporting the C++11 standard required incompatible changes to libstdc++ ABI.  Instead of bumping the library soname (I still do not understand why that was not done…), the GCC developers decided to have a <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/libstdc++/manual/using_dual_abi.html">dual ABI</a>.  This is achieved using C++11 inlined namespaces which will give a different mangled name allowing types that differ across the two ABIs to coexist.  When that is insufficient, a new <tt>abi_tag</tt> <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/C_002b_002b-Attributes.html">attribute</a> is used which adds <tt>[abi:cxx11]</tt> to the mangled name.</p>
<p>With the initial upload of <tt>gcc-5.1</tt> to the Arch repos, we configured GCC to use the old ABI by default.  Now the initial slew of bugs have been dealt with (or mostly dealt with…), we want to switch to the new ABI.  Because this was going to be a much larger rebuild than usual, one of the Arch developers (<a href="https://www.archlinux.org/people/developers/#foutrelis">Evangelos Foutras</a>) developed a server that automatically orders the rebuilds, and provides the next rebuild when a client requests it (this may be the future of rebuild automation in Arch).</p>
<p>This discovered an issue when building software using the new C++ ABI with <tt>clang</tt>, which builds against the new ABI (as instructed in the GCC header file), but does not know about the <tt>abi_tag</tt> attribute.  This results in problems such as (for example) any function in a library with a <tt>std::string</tt> return type will be mangled with a <tt>[abi:cxx11]</tt> ABI tag.  Clang does not handle these ABI tags, so will not add the tag to the mangled name and then linking will fail.</p>
<p>This issue was pointed out on a GCC mailing list in <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-patches/2015-04/msg00153.html">April</a>, and a bug was filed independently for <a href="https://llvm.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=23529">LLVM/clang</a>.  Until it is fixed, Arch Linux will not be able to switch to the new ABI.  Note, this also has consequences for all older versions of GCC wanting to compile C++ software against system libraries…</p>

              <p>Normally when you write an article and label it with part one, it is followed soon after with a part two. Well, a lot more than two years later, I discovered this draft…. So this is part two of me rambling about what I think it means to keep packages “vanilla”.  See <a href="http://allanmcrae.com/2013/01/keeping-packages-vanilla-1-patching/">here</a> for the first part in which I discussed patching.  Looking at configure options and dependencies is probably less clear than patching, but lets see if I come to a conclusion in this wall of text!</p>
<p>As I said in the previous post, in an ideal world we could just do “<tt>./configure; make; make install</tt>” and all packages would build perfectly and interact with each other the way they are supposed to.  I will attempt to categorize the various options that can be added to <tt>configure</tt> and by how they change the package.  This will be mostly done by looking at examples from the packages I maintain (or now, packages that I used to maintain) for Arch Linux.</p>
<p>The first type of configure option that will (almost) always be used is setting paths for where various files are located.  Most Linux distributions will build their packages with “<tt>--prefix=/usr</tt>” and perhaps several other configuration options to set file paths.  Arch Linux is not a fan of the <tt>/libexec</tt> directory so uses <tt>--libexecdir=/usr/lib</tt> where needed. (It appears that moving away from that directory is becoming widespread these days, right after the draft FHS added it…) There used to be a lot of moving of man and info pages to the “right place”, but that is automatically done in most packages these days.  I doubt that anyone would consider these types of configuration options to make a package non-vanilla, unless they were set to very extreme values.</p>
<p>The second set of configure flags are those that enable additional features.  For example, <a href="http://gmplib.org/">GMP</a> can be built using the configure flag <tt>--enable-cxx</tt> to enable C++ support.  That builds an additional library and adds an extra header to the package, but does not alter the primary library.  Similarly, using <tt>--enable-pcre16</tt> and <tt>--enable-pcre32</tt> when configuring <a href="http://www.pcre.org/">PCRE</a> adds 16 and 32 bit character support libraries.  Given these options have no effect on the primary part of the software and just add completely separate parts to it, it would be hard to argue that such configuration options are not vanilla.</p>
<p>So lets move onto configuration options that actually alter the software.  Lets start with glibc, binutils and gcc which all have</p>
<p><code>--with-bugurl=https://bugs.archlinux.org/</code></p>
<p>set in the Arch Linux packages.  Is that vanilla?  It can be argued that I am setting a value not considered by upstream, but clearly upstream thought allowing the package to set such a value was a good idea given there is a configuration option.  So I’d say that is still vanilla.</p>
<p>How about <a href="http://www.greenwoodsoftware.com/less/">Less</a> which is configured with <tt>--with-regex=pcre</tt> and adds a dependency to the software.  There is actually quite a number of possible values for this configuration option:</p>
<p><code>--with-regex={auto,gnu,pcre,posix,regcmp,re_comp,regcomp,regcomp-local,none}</code></p>
<p>Looking at that list, I would suppose <tt>auto</tt> is the most vanilla, as that is what happens if you do not specify the option.  But it is also the least deterministic, in that it will pick a different option based on what is installed on your system.  In fact, on my system it picks “<tt>posix</tt>” by default, which was a moderate surprise to me.  Given that these options are all provided by the software developer (and so should all be supported), I think you could make the case they all are vanilla.  But I would be surprised to see (at least) the last five options used on any Linux system, so calling them vanilla is a stretch.</p>
<p>What is the conclusion?  I suppose that configuration options are mostly put there to be used by the upstream developers so any use of them would be considered vanilla.  But keep in mind what a software developer would expect.  Picking strange configurations compared to what is usual for your operating system is likely to get you (virtual) weird looks from upstream, so that can not be considered a vanilla configuration.</p>
<p>Perhaps this part is more boring than the discussion of patching.  But the second part of a trilogy is rarely the greatest. Part 3 should appear soon…</p>

              <p>I know this is premature, considering as we’re only halfway through the year. But May marks the 30th month of this blog, and even though I don’t have statistics, I suspect that there were an unusually high number of tip-top terminal titles in that short span.</p>
<p>So as a final nod to truly great software, I’m going back through anything from the first half of this year, and maybe even creeping a little into the last days of December. Let’s look one more time at the stuff that really shines.</p>

The first gold-star-winner of 2015 was a geekplosion going by the name of horst. In the grand cornucopia of wireless monitors and network tools, horst is a thoroughbred with plenty of visual yummies to keep you entertained. I know next to nothing about wireless technology, except to start up a network manager in hopes of reaching my e-mail. I started up horst once — just once, mind you — and every geek within 25 meters was suddenly and inexplicably pulled directly to my laptop screen. horst may be a great way to get more information about the invisible networks that float around us all, or it may be a good way to meet the geek of your dreams … if <em>you</em> are not already the geek of your dreams, that is. <span class="wp-smiley wp-emoji wp-emoji-rolleyes" title=":roll:">:roll:</span>

It’s probably not fair to pick at fdd for being a good decade or two beyond its intended audience, and given that it has provisions for CD and other removable media, it’s still useful in this day and age. All the same, it is obviously intended for a different generation, when keeping track of floppies was a tedious chore. With lots of options for searching and naming, fdd wins a tip of the straw skimmer in recognition of a good design regardless of its Precambrian origins. You laugh, but one day you’ll be scraping around the Internet trying to remember the name of this program, so you can use it to catalog your overloaded USB stick collection. …

I make a big deal out of text editors that aren’t the twin cancers of the console, <a href="https://inconsolation.wordpress.com/2014/06/20/vim-dont-start-celebrating-just-yet/" title="vim: Don’t start celebrating just yet" target="_blank">vim</a> and <a href="https://inconsolation.wordpress.com/2013/10/20/emacs-brace-for-impact/" title="emacs: Brace for impact" target="_blank">emacs</a>. Picking between those two is like asking if you’d rather be hit between the eyes with a ball-peen hammer or with a cricket bat: Neither one is a reasonable choice for a rational computer-using human-type person. And the third-place finisher, <a href="https://inconsolation.wordpress.com/2014/01/29/nano-were-number-three-we-try-harder/" title="nano: We’re number three, we try harder" target="_blank">nano</a>, is so far behind that it’s really just a timid, simpering speck on the horizon. For an editor with real character, wpe and it’s non-programmer version, we, are sheer genius. Built-in file selectors, popup menus, a Van Gogh-ish palette of color, menu bars, cascading and tiling windows, syntax highlighting and sensible defaults — anything you could want in a text editor without having to suffer through the mind-numbing triple-key combos of emacs, or the asinine, feverish mode-swapping of vim. Yes, that’s right, I just called your editor mind-numbing and asinine. You got problem with that? <span class="wp-smiley wp-emoji wp-emoji-evil" title=":evil:">:evil:</span> I’m getting bold in my last days. … <span class="wp-smiley wp-emoji wp-emoji-surprised" title=":shock:">:shock:</span>

I was sorely tempted to throw httping to the top of the list, as a technological salt lick for free-ranging geeks in your local environment. But httping gets its own bracket, and wins the judges’ choice for the most hopelessly overdone title of 2015 — especially since it is, at its core, a rewrite of the omnipresent <a href="https://inconsolation.wordpress.com/2014/03/04/ping-everybody-wants-to-be-the-ping/" title="ping: Everybody wants to be the ping" target="_blank">ping</a> utility. Some ping remakes are content to emit beeps, or bounce like EKGs, or just show a little more information than the classic tool. But that’s not enough for httping, which was obviously exposed to a massive overdose of gamma radiation, because it comes out of the chute like The Hulk jacked up on methamphetamines. httping gives you every possible modulation on ping you can imagine, plus some you only saw in your nightmares. Look, everybody wants to be the ping, but this is just ridiculous. <span class="wp-smiley wp-emoji wp-emoji-surprised" title=":shock:">:shock:</span>

I’m lumping titles here, which probably isn’t fair, but if you wanted to set up an entire suite of software to manage your home office on a leftover K6-III, you got five grand programs just in the first half of this year. <strong>tapecalc</strong> is a majestic redesign of the office adding machine archetype, suitable for tabulation, accounting and even just simple math, and won’t run up your budget by burning through that awful thermal printer paper. <strong>mined</strong> is another prime example of why both <a href="https://inconsolation.wordpress.com/2014/06/20/vim-dont-start-celebrating-just-yet/" title="vim: Don’t start celebrating just yet" target="_blank">vim</a> and <a href="https://inconsolation.wordpress.com/2013/10/20/emacs-brace-for-impact/" title="emacs: Brace for impact" target="_blank">emacs</a> should be completely discarded and all their prophets exiled to a very cold place, and a magnificent example of how easy text-based editing should be. 
<p><strong>alot</strong> won out over <a href="https://inconsolation.wordpress.com/2015/01/17/multimail-a-rubberstamp-endorsement/" title="multimail: A rubberstamp endorsement" target="_blank">multimail</a> as an easy-to-learn, easy-to-manage and easy-to-read mail agent, even if the supporting software will be a bear to set up for some people (myself included). <strong>ol</strong> is the baby of the crowd, proving its worth just days ago as a to-do list manager and hierarchical note taker, even if it doesn’t have all the flash of some others. And <strong>scim</strong> wins the seat of honor in the text-based office suite, for bringing the decades-old spreadsheet <a href="https://inconsolation.wordpress.com/2013/06/22/sc-old-as-the-hills/" title="sc: Old as the hills" target="_blank">sc</a> back to modernity, and adding so many desperately needed features that you’ll think it’s Christmas. Even if you weren’t around for all 2 1/2 years of this blog, look at those five programs and you’ll have enough to keep your K6-III busy. (Hey, don’t laugh: Those old Super Socket 7’s are regaining their value, now that they’re vintage technology. …)</p>

It was probably easy to see coming, but <strong>shpaint</strong> was a winner in the visual arts department for making terminal emulator art as easy as point-and-click. I don’t know what sorcery makes it possible to do that from bash, of all places, but shpaint made me all misty-eyed, remembering the good old days of Paint Now! (Massive bonus points if you know that one.) Granted, it didn’t really stand up to some of the higher features of other graphics programs, but all told, it was the best artistic invention for the year. 
<p>And speaking of artistic endeavors, <strong>mpfc</strong> overshadowed any and all music players for the console in the last six months, by adopting an easy interface, great color, good sound and a lightweight footprint.

The reddit army can stop harassing me for not thinking too highly of their stomping ground, and take solace in the fact that rtv is probably one of the nicest console-based forum browsers dedicated to a single web site. Good color, an arrangement that mimics the visual style of the site, one-key commands for the most common actions, and account management for ease of startup. I’m almost sad that it really only works with one site; a tool like this that could rip through forums and BBSs would be a godsend. I may not be a fan of reddit, but using rtv could be reason enough to visit it.

I pulled out a lot of hair before I made this decision. For as brief a time as we had together in 2015, a lot — and I mean a <strong>lot</strong> — of that time was spent on games. Some of them were magnificent too: <a href="https://inconsolation.wordpress.com/2015/03/24/frozen-depths-clear-cold-perfection/" title="Frozen Depths: Clear, cold perfection" target="_blank"><strong>Frozen Depths</strong></a> aligned itself with the topmost rung of roguelikes, making it a peer of things like <a href="https://inconsolation.wordpress.com/2013/06/05/cataclysm-the-zombie-apocalypse-starts-now/" title="cataclysm: The zombie apocalypse starts now" target="_blank">Cataclysm DDA</a> and <a href="https://inconsolation.wordpress.com/2013/03/14/crawl-still-the-king-of-the-heap/" title="crawl: Still the king of the heap" target="_blank">Dungeon Crawl</a>. <a href="https://inconsolation.wordpress.com/2015/03/31/nsuds-a-text-based-tour-de-force/" title="nsuds: A text-based tour-de-force" target="_blank"><strong>nsuds</strong></a> was so well made that it could have been a tutorial on how to design a text-based console game. And if you didn’t know better, <a href="https://inconsolation.wordpress.com/2015/03/22/net-o-grama-an-ancient-idea-done-very-well/" title="net-o-grama: An ancient idea, done very well" target="_blank"><strong>net-o-grama</strong></a> could trick you into thinking it was a graphical game. Even <a href="https://inconsolation.wordpress.com/2015/03/15/hack-of-life-conway-would-be-proud/" title="hack-of-life: Conway would be proud" target="_blank"><strong>hack-of-life</strong></a> managed to astound me, and that game was built on the ancient carcass of a decades-old theoretical population simulation. It was a good six months for games, no matter how you looked at it.
<p>In the end though, it was the simple novelty of <strong>scrap</strong> that won me over. I was still puttering around with scrap for days after I had written about it, in between the other games that I was skimming through. It’s not a perfect game (what is?) and it is at risk of disappearing into the technological ether of history, if archive.org ever jettisons it. But for sheer fun, a simple but challenging premise and a colorful interface, scrap won the crown. Please accept my heartiest endorsement.</p>

And that’s it. That’s all I have to say. I’ve come to the end of all the lists and wikis, indexes and repositories, collections and top-10-lists. <span class="wp-smiley wp-emoji wp-emoji-sad" title=":(">:(</span> 
<p>Now I’m afraid our time together must come to a close.</p>
<p>I don’t have any words of wisdom beyond what I left at the top of <a href="http://kmandla.wordpress.com" target="_blank">the old blog</a>. We had a good decade, and I hope the past 30 months of silly little text-only adventures were as interesting — and maybe educational — for you as they were for me. </p>
<p>Keep trying new things, keep looking for simpler solutions, and keep using the programs you like best. And remember: Be kind to one another. We’re all we’ve got!</p>

<li>
<a href="https://github.com/progers/content-screenshot" target="_blank"><strong>content-screenshot</strong></a>: I believe this relies on Chromium, so I’ve omitted it as a graphical program.</li>
<li>
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/deco/" target="_blank"><strong>deco</strong></a>: A text-based two-pane file manager patterned after <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norton_Commander" target="_blank">Norton Commander</a>. This wouldn’t build for me, and I see on the home page that it has been deprecated in favor of another file manager. I’m afraid the code is just too old.</li>
<li>
<a href="http://ambrevar.bitbucket.org/demlo/" target="_blank"><strong>demlo</strong></a>: A software structure for tagging and organizing music. I’ve had this on my list for quite a while, but I ran out of steam with tagging utilities <a href="https://inconsolation.wordpress.com/2014/12/10/tagfs-xtagfs-dhtfs-and-more-tag-youre-it/" title="tagfs, xtagfs, dhtfs and more: Tag, you’re it" target="_blank">way back in December</a>. And then I just plain ran out of time. <span class="wp-smiley wp-emoji wp-emoji-sad" title=":(">:(</span>

<li>
<a href="http://pu.inf.uni-tuebingen.de/users/sperber/software/dired/" target="_blank"><strong>dired</strong></a>: I suspect there are two dired’s: <a href="http://fossies.org/linux/misc/old/" target="_blank">an old one</a> that runs within <a href="https://inconsolation.wordpress.com/2013/10/20/emacs-brace-for-impact/" title="emacs: Brace for impact" target="_blank">emacs</a>, and a newer one that works independently. My confusion over the name and my difficulties getting the old one to work kept knocking this file manager down my priority list, and now I hand it off to you.</li>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/iwonbigbro/gsync" target="_blank"><strong>gsync</strong></a>: A tool to synchronize folders against Google Drive. I could build and run this, but it never synced against my account. I suspect Google has updated its protocol to the point where gsync can no longer communicate with the cloud, as sometimes happens.</li>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/sananth12/ImageScraper" target="_blank"><strong>ImageScraper</strong></a>: An image downloader. A submission via e-mail, this never worked for me as promised, even when I buckled and tried to install it with pip.</li>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/ceryn/img" target="_blank"><strong>img</strong></a>: An image uploader specific to <a href="http://imgur.com" target="_blank">imgur.com</a>. To be honest, imgur’s pages are always terribly heavy and laden with gimmicks that make it slow to navigate on a 12-year-old computer, so I never bothered trying it. Plus, I’ve outlived three or four third-party image hosts over the past decade, so I don’t have much need for imgur.</li>
<li>
<a href="https://imgur.com/tools/imgurbash.sh" target="_blank"><strong>imgbash.sh</strong></a>: I believe this is imgur.com’s in-house upload script, which may or may not be better than the previous title. Again, I leave that to you to discover.</li>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/rafaelmartins/marrie/" target="_blank"><strong>marrie</strong></a>: Martin sent me a link to marrie just yesterday, no doubt in response to the deluge of podcast downloaders of last week. You sent it just in under the wire, Martin, but you left me no time to try it … <span class="wp-smiley wp-emoji wp-emoji-confused" title=":???:">:???:</span>
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/jacebrowning/mine" target="_blank"><strong>mine</strong></a>: A console interface for <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/" target="_blank">Dropbox</a>, which could be quite useful if you rely on Dropbox for cloud storage. I think you can actually run software from the cloud too. <span class="wp-smiley wp-emoji wp-emoji-neutral" title=":|">:|</span> I didn’t get the chance to try this at all, but I do have a Dropbox account … somewhere. … <span class="wp-smiley wp-emoji wp-emoji-confused" title=":???:">:???:</span>

<li>
<a href="http://www.djcbsoftware.nl/code/mu/mu4e.html" target="_blank"><strong>mu4e</strong></a>: Another mail agent for emacs. The next blog will be “How to take care of all your computing needs from within emacs.” Just kidding. <span class="wp-smiley wp-emoji wp-emoji-rolleyes" title=":roll:">:roll:</span> If I remember right, there’s a standalone version (in other words, without the need for emacs) just called “mu.” And now, little man, I give the watch to you. </li>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/eneva002/rhype" target="_blank"><strong>rhype</strong></a>: A music player specific to <a href="http://hypem.com/" target="_blank">Hype Machine</a>. I did due diligence with this, but it came up lacking. Lazy responses from the daemon, almost no control over the actual player doing the work, and very sluggish behavior when trying to access the playlist. See if you have better luck though.</li>
</ul>
<p>And there it is: The end of the end. Everything I know and ever got, whether through my own efforts or through he kindness of contributors, is now somewhere on this site. All the 400 original tools and the 2000 or so that followed are public record. A treasure trove, for generations to come. <span class="wp-smiley wp-emoji wp-emoji-cry" title=":'(">:'(</span></p>

              <p>About a month ago, <a href="https://inconsolation.wordpress.com/2015/03/27/z-day-a-slightly-different-perspective-on-slaughtering-zombies/comment-page-1/#comment-17635" target="_blank">StreaK left a note</a> about <a href="http://ndn.muxe.com/download/" target="_blank">ndn</a>, a/k/a Necromancer’s DOS Navigator. I might catch some flak for this, but I saved it for last, before the shop closes down.</p>

<p>Introductions first. ndn has a precompiled Linux version that you see there, and as you might expect from the screenshots, I find it quite enjoyable. You can see the two-panel menu-based approach that hearkens back to <a href="https://inconsolation.wordpress.com/2014/01/05/midnight-commander-the-industry-standard/" title="Midnight Commander: The industry standard" target="_blank">Midnight Commander</a> and its predecessor, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norton_Commander" target="_blank">Norton Commander</a>. </p>
<p>ndn takes that style and adds multiple window support, a healthy smattering of disk functions (like renaming a volume, like you see above), separate histories for command line and panel activity, and a lot of other tricks. Most everything is driven by a popup dialogue, which I always appreciate.</p>
<p>Even more amazing, ndn adds in a calculator, a calendar, a phone book (remember, this has history back to the modem era), and a lot more. If you try ndn, take your time with the “Utilities” menu, but don’t be shy about the others either.</p>
<p>Much of what ndn can do is arranged by submenu, and that makes it mostly easy to follow. There are also provisions for user-defined menus, and a special function menu just for Linux tasks.</p>
<p>With all that going for it, I still have a few small problems to report. First, as you can probably see if you look close at the screenshots, I’m getting some screen artifacts when I run the precompiled version in Arch. I don’t blame anyone for that; it’s a distraction, but it’s just the nature of the beast.</p>
<p>Second, there are some obvious leftover “tools” and “menus” from the DOS era. The letter strip you see along the bottom of each panel clearly corresponds to drive labels under Windows, and double-clicking on one in Linux just drops you into /dev/, which doesn’t really help. </p>
<p>It would be nice if that area instead showed mountpoints or even polled devices like sda1, sdb1, sr0 and so forth. As it is, that strip is wasted space. Add to wasted space: Displaying file names in the same color as the background for certain file types. That’s an unfortunate oversight. <span class="wp-smiley wp-emoji wp-emoji-uneasy" title=":\">:\</span></p>
<p>ndn is also a very powerful suite of tools, and will take a lot of time to learn all the commands. But to complicate things, it appears there are different controls when running under X and when in a virtual console. Keyboard navigation seems disabled under X, meaning you have to do all your selections and menu action with the mouse. On the other hand, gpm was no help in a console.</p>
<p>Those are the main reasons I was hesitant to include ndn in this list: It seems a lot of its functions will hinge on graphical support. Which makes it not much better than <a href="https://inconsolation.wordpress.com/2015/04/24/undistract-me-quashing-your-adhd/" title="undistract-me: Quashing your ADHD" target="_blank">undistract-me</a>, which we talked about a few days ago.</p>
<p>And why save it for last, you ask? Nostalgia, mostly. If you remember the text-only era and the parade of file managers and disk checkers that all ran within consoles and had no graphical support, ndn is like a trip down memory lane. Popup menus drawn and shaded in hashed boxes, menu bars triggered with ALT+letters, and F-row hotkeys will take you back to the software of 30 years ago … all the way down to the color scheme. It’s a good feeling.</p>
<p>So if you take issue with a leftover DOS file manager, overstocked with utilities and rather haphazardly converted to Linux, appearing here at all, that’s my excuse: It reminds me of other times. <span class="wp-smiley wp-emoji wp-emoji-smile" title=":)">:)</span></p><br> Tagged: <a href="https://inconsolation.wordpress.com/tag/file/">file</a>, <a href="https://inconsolation.wordpress.com/tag/manager/">manager</a> <img border="0" src="https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=inconsolation.wordpress.com&amp;blog=43062292&amp;post=9717&amp;subd=inconsolation&amp;ref=&amp;feed=1" width="1" height="1">

              <p>A long time ago, I used to keep notes and lists with a normal, everyday text editor, and just draw up a outline format if I needed to show some sort of structure or to-do checkboxes. </p>
<p>Sometime around 2008 or 2009, I found two new applications that quickly took over those roles — one was <a href="https://inconsolation.wordpress.com/2014/06/20/vimwiki-the-reason-in-due-season/" title="vimwiki: The reason, in due season" target="_blank">vimwiki</a>, which I may only need for another day or two, and <a href="https://inconsolation.wordpress.com/2013/05/21/hnb-quick-clever-and-clean/" title="hnb: Quick, clever and clean" target="_blank">hnb</a>. hnb was on my system, in spite of its age, for a long five years until I found <a href="https://inconsolation.wordpress.com/2014/06/13/tudu-the-hnb-killer/" title="tudu: The hnb-killer" target="_blank">tudu</a> last summer.</p>
<p>hnb and tudu (and the emacs and vim plugins that do much the same thing) are not the only hierarchical note-takers available. You can add <a href="https://github.com/badsector/ol" target="_blank">ol</a> to that list, with my endorsement … whatever that’s worth. <span class="wp-smiley wp-emoji wp-emoji-rolleyes" title=":roll:">:roll:</span></p>
<p><a href="https://inconsolation.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/2015-04-26-6m47421-ol.png"><img src="https://inconsolation.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/2015-04-26-6m47421-ol.png?w=150&amp;h=91" alt="2015-04-26-6m47421-ol" width="150" height="91" class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-9712"></a></p>
<p>ol stands for “Outliner Lighto,” if the home page is to be believed. And what you see in that image is probably the best snapshot of what it does and how it works.</p>
<p>Arrow keys will navigate through a tree, and leaf nodes expand when you navigate through them. Press “d” to delete a note and all its children, Enter to edit a note, “t” to convert it to a checkbox for to-do lists, “x” to mark a task as done, and so forth. The empty file startup screen will give you help and instructions, if you need it.</p>
<p>Probably one of my favorite things about ol is the cut-and-paste action, or better called the “grab” function. Press “g” and you carry a note with you through the tree, allowing you to arrange and rearrange to your heart’s desire. </p>
<p>Since the display effectively updates as you navigate, it’s a lot easier to organize and visualize than the traditional cut-and-paste model. I like that a lot more than tudu’s way, which borrows yank-and-paste style of <a href="https://inconsolation.wordpress.com/2014/06/20/vim-dont-start-celebrating-just-yet/" title="vim: Don’t start celebrating just yet" target="_blank">vim</a>. And you know how I feel about vim. <span class="wp-smiley wp-emoji wp-emoji-evil" title=":evil:">:evil:</span></p>
<p>ol is also colorful, even going so far as to assign colors to note depths, which is another wise evolution. hnb and tudu haven’t picked up that idea yet, and it’s one that is probably worth adopting.</p>
<p>I see that ol is written in pascal, which strikes me as unusual, but also completely irrelevant to using the program. As an added bonus, if you’re an hnb user and decide to use this moment to emigrate, there’s a utility that will convert hnb’s text format to a style ol can use.</p>
<p>ol doesn’t have some of the more detailed functions of tudu — like displaying a percentage complete for to-do lists, or allowing extended notes, deadlines and schedule dates. ol probably won’t dethrone tudu for me, for those reasons. I find with tudu that I can rely less on <a href="https://inconsolation.wordpress.com/2013/03/15/wyrd-a-face-for-remind/" title="wyrd: Putting a face on remind" target="_blank">wyrd</a> now too.</p>
<p>That alone is no reason to deny ol the gold star it deserves — for a clean interface, plenty of startup help, easy controls and a few innovative ideas for hierarchical list tools. Don’t spend it all in one place: <span class="wp-smiley wp-emoji wp-emoji-star" title=":star:">:star:</span> Enjoy! <span class="wp-smiley wp-emoji wp-emoji-smile" title=":)">:)</span></p><br> Tagged: <a href="https://inconsolation.wordpress.com/tag/manager/">manager</a>, <a href="https://inconsolation.wordpress.com/tag/note/">note</a>, <a href="https://inconsolation.wordpress.com/tag/organizer/">organizer</a>, <a href="https://inconsolation.wordpress.com/tag/task/">task</a>, <a href="https://inconsolation.wordpress.com/tag/to-do/">to-do</a> <img border="0" src="https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=inconsolation.wordpress.com&amp;blog=43062292&amp;post=9711&amp;subd=inconsolation&amp;ref=&amp;feed=1" width="1" height="1">

So you can see the last portions of pacman.log at the top of that image, then the repository update. The next invocation of since only shows the two lines that had been added.</p>
<p>I’m sure other <a href="https://inconsolation.wordpress.com/2014/08/04/head-and-tail-flip-a-coin/" title="head and tail: Flip a coin" target="_blank">tail</a>-esque tools can do this, and possibly add a few nifty tricks in passing. It’s just a matter of finding the right flags and getting them in order.</p>
<p>For its own part, since keeps its state file in ~/.since, and you have the option to ignore it. You can also tell since to use a special state file, to run periodically, to ignore compressed logs, ignore missing logs, and a lot of other options.</p>
<p>I am not a real bloodhound when it comes to keeping an eye on logs, so at its best, since is useful … but only rarely. On my pseudo-desktop system, there’s almost no call for it. </p>
<p>On a more complex system or in a situation where log files are critical, it might save you some time trying to get the information you need. I’m willing to give it a thumbs-up. <span class="wp-smiley wp-emoji wp-emoji-smile" title=":)">:)</span></p><br> Tagged: <a href="https://inconsolation.wordpress.com/tag/information/">information</a>, <a href="https://inconsolation.wordpress.com/tag/log/">log</a>, <a href="https://inconsolation.wordpress.com/tag/system/">system</a>, <a href="https://inconsolation.wordpress.com/tag/tail/">tail</a>, <a href="https://inconsolation.wordpress.com/tag/viewer/">viewer</a> <img border="0" src="https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=inconsolation.wordpress.com&amp;blog=43062292&amp;post=9704&amp;subd=inconsolation&amp;ref=&amp;feed=1" width="1" height="1">

              <p>I have a couple of simple but related tools today, both from the same author. At left is <a href="https://github.com/bfontaine/rfc" target="_blank">rfc</a>, and at right is <a href="https://github.com/bfontaine/httpdoc" target="_blank">httpdoc</a>.</p>

<p>I’ve known about rfc for a while, but got a reminder about httpdoc earlier this week via e-mail. Since they both have the same style and same creator, it makes sense to lump them together.</p>
<p>rfc, when supplied with a number or a topic line, will pull the text of that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Request_for_Comments" target="_blank">RFC</a> from the web and dump it into your $PAGER. No fancy formatting, no color-coded document histories, just one-shot quick access to RFCs all the way back to … well, back to <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1" target="_blank">number 1</a>.</p>
<p>The home page has a three-step process for “installing” rfc into your $HOME directory, although I daresay it could be rearranged to allow for more than just one person to use. In any case, it takes very little effort and rfc itself won’t bog down your system, seeing as it’s just a bash creation. </p>
<p>As an added bonus, rfc will keep its documents stored locally, so you don’t have to re-download a request. If you rely on rfc frequently, you’ll probably be interested in some of the built-in actions — like <code>update</code> or <code>list</code>, which give rfc a little more oomph, and <code>search</code>, which … well, you should be able to figure that one out. <span class="wp-smiley wp-emoji wp-emoji-rolleyes" title=":roll:">:roll:</span></p>
<p>httpdoc is similar, in a way. As you can see above, httpdoc becomes an offline reference tool for HTTP documentation. In the screenshot above, I only showed the 404 status code, but httpdoc can also return documentation on header fields, if you need that. </p>
<p>I can see where httpdoc is still being updated even in the past few days, so I expect there will be more references to come.</p>
<p>httpdoc is written in go, so you’ll need that installed before it will play along. There are also some environment variables that you’ll want to adjust before using it, but it’s nothing complicated.</p>
<p>Both of these tools might strike you as too simple to be noteworthy, but that will depend a lot on your perspective. I use things like <a href="https://inconsolation.wordpress.com/2013/10/12/dict-another-great-tool-for-writers/" title="dict: Another great tool for writers" target="_blank">dict</a> on a daily basis, and even have it hot-wired for thesaurus entries as part of my .bashrc. </p>
<p>If you have a similar need for RFC or HTTP documentation at the command line, then you might find both of these install-worthy. Necessity is the mother of invention. Or is it the other way around … ? <span class="wp-smiley wp-emoji wp-emoji-wink" title=";)">;)</span></p><br> Tagged: <a href="https://inconsolation.wordpress.com/tag/documentation/">documentation</a>, <a href="https://inconsolation.wordpress.com/tag/html/">html</a>, <a href="https://inconsolation.wordpress.com/tag/http/">http</a>, <a href="https://inconsolation.wordpress.com/tag/reference/">reference</a>, <a href="https://inconsolation.wordpress.com/tag/references/">references</a> <img border="0" src="https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=inconsolation.wordpress.com&amp;blog=43062292&amp;post=9698&amp;subd=inconsolation&amp;ref=&amp;feed=1" width="1" height="1">

              <p>I fear <a href="http://mumak.net/undistract-me/" target="_blank">this little utility</a> might be usable only for a discrete set of fans. Technically speaking it’s a text-based application, but … well, I’ll let you take a look and see what you think.</p>
<p><a href="https://inconsolation.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/2015-04-24-lr-0xtbe-undistract-me.png"><img src="https://inconsolation.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/2015-04-24-lr-0xtbe-undistract-me.png?w=150&amp;h=84" alt="2015-04-24-lr-0xtbe-undistract-me" width="150" height="84" class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-9694"></a></p>
<p>In principle, it’s rather simple: undistract-me simply takes note if a shell command takes longer than 10 seconds to execute. If it does, it waits until the program finishes, then throws up the alert message you see in the screenshot above. Kind of cool, in an odd way.</p>
<p>Strictly speaking though, you’ll need all the underpinnings of a graphical desktop, plus whatever alert system is in use there, before you’ll get close to that kind of behavior. On my semi-graphical Arch system with just Openbox, I ended up adding gtk3, polkit, dconf, json-glib and a mess of themes and libraries before the git version was close to running.</p>
<p>So I don’t know if I’m being fair by including it. Don’t expect to suddenly plop this into place on your 400Mhz Celeron running <a href="https://inconsolation.wordpress.com/2014/04/19/screen-the-granddaddy-of-terminal-multiplexers/" title="screen: The granddaddy of terminal multiplexers" target="_blank">screen</a>, because you’re going to need a lot more to get close.</p>
<p>I won’t deny that I like the idea though, and if something comparable could be implemented in a text only environment, it might be worth trying. For my own part, I used to append long-running commands with <code>aplay yoo-hoo.ogg</code> so I would get an audible when something finished.</p>
<p>So in that way, I can sympathize. But unless you use a lot of terminal commands on a Linux Mint desktop and need some sort of blinky reminder when one finishes … well, like I said, it will probably only appeal to a slim range of fans. <span class="wp-smiley wp-emoji wp-emoji-uneasy" title=":\">:\</span></p><br> Tagged: <a href="https://inconsolation.wordpress.com/tag/command/">command</a>, <a href="https://inconsolation.wordpress.com/tag/desktop/">desktop</a>, <a href="https://inconsolation.wordpress.com/tag/finish/">finish</a>, <a href="https://inconsolation.wordpress.com/tag/notify/">notify</a> <img border="0" src="https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=inconsolation.wordpress.com&amp;blog=43062292&amp;post=9693&amp;subd=inconsolation&amp;ref=&amp;feed=1" width="1" height="1">

              <p>I am behind the power curve today, because of some real-life obligations. I am going to grab something quick and easy so as not to fall behind; things are going to be even busier into the weekend.</p>
<p>This is a snapshot of <a href="https://github.com/sahib/rmlint" target="_blank">rmlint</a> in action:</p>
<p><a href="https://inconsolation.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/2015-04-23-l3-b7175-rmlint.png"><img src="https://inconsolation.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/2015-04-23-l3-b7175-rmlint.png?w=150&amp;h=90" alt="2015-04-23-l3-b7175-rmlint" width="150" height="90" class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-9691"></a></p>
<p>rmlint cruises through your directory tree, and offers to remove files it thinks are duplicates, zero-byte or hollow folders. And as you can see, given enough space, it will take its time to come up with a menu of potential excisions.</p>
<p>I did say “offers,” which is an important distinction. rmlint’s output is a little unexpected: By default it generates a script that will remove suspicious targets, but doesn’t outright eliminate them.</p>
<p>Which is a good thing; it means you have the option to adjust its list, and it also means you take the next step — running the script — with conscious aforethought. You can’t blame rmlint for whacking apart your /usr/lib folder if you told it specifically to do it.</p>
<p>I like rmlint for a number of reasons — it’s rare that I see a system cleaner, it takes the safe route by creating the script, and it has a smidgen of color. </p>
<p>But that’s about all the time I have today; I’ll get deeper into something tomorrow … I promise. <span class="wp-smiley wp-emoji wp-emoji-wink" title=";)">;)</span></p><br> Tagged: <a href="https://inconsolation.wordpress.com/tag/cleaner/">cleaner</a>, <a href="https://inconsolation.wordpress.com/tag/directory/">directory</a>, <a href="https://inconsolation.wordpress.com/tag/duplicate/">duplicate</a>, <a href="https://inconsolation.wordpress.com/tag/file/">file</a>, <a href="https://inconsolation.wordpress.com/tag/folder/">folder</a>, <a href="https://inconsolation.wordpress.com/tag/system/">system</a> <img border="0" src="https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=inconsolation.wordpress.com&amp;blog=43062292&amp;post=9690&amp;subd=inconsolation&amp;ref=&amp;feed=1" width="1" height="1">

              <p>With barely a week left for this site, I’m beginning to trim away programs that I just probably won’t get to, by virtue of time or technical dilemmas. I’m also making a conscious effort to pick out titles that amuse me in one form or another, so I finish with happy memories. <span class="wp-smiley wp-emoji wp-emoji-tongue" title=":P">:P</span></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/krockode/x_x" target="_blank">x_x</a>, which I mentally refer to as “the Dead Guy CLI,” because the home page uses that as a subtitle, is a rather nifty tool that I’m surprised I haven’t seen covered elsewhere. Using a bland, dull, boring Excel spreadsheet borrowed from a corner of the Interweb, Dead Guy CLI transmogrifies it into this:</p>
<p><a href="https://inconsolation.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/2015-04-21-6m47421-x_x.png"><img src="https://inconsolation.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/2015-04-21-6m47421-x_x.png?w=150&amp;h=91" alt="2015-04-21-6m47421-x_x" width="150" height="91" class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-9686"></a></p>
<p>Well isn’t that clever.</p>
<p>Dead Guy CLI gives you a small measure of control over your output, by allowing you to specify a header row or allow for special encoding. It also works with CSV files, so you’re not strapped trying to <a href="https://inconsolation.wordpress.com/2014/08/09/csv2xls-back-to-the-harmless-and-mundane/" title="csv2xls: Back to the harmless and mundane" target="_blank">convert back and forth to Excel</a>, just to fiddle with x_x.</p>
<p>Aside from that though, Dead Guy CLI seems very simple. Of course, your spreadsheet may need some management if you expect it to fit into a certain dimension, but I am confident that as a skilled and capable member of the information age, you won’t throw a wobbly over a pear-shaped spreadsheet.</p>
<p>Keep x_x in mind when you’re thinking about things like csv2xls or <a href="https://inconsolation.wordpress.com/2014/07/05/xlhtml-and-ppthtml-not-only-word-needs-converting/" title="xlhtml and ppthtml: Not only Word needs converting" target="_blank">xlhtml</a>, since it may save you a step or prevent you from relying on graphical tools just to extract data from a spreadsheet. And of course, if you’re working with csv files, x_x could supplement what <a href="https://inconsolation.wordpress.com/2014/05/16/tabview-csv-files-have-never-been-cooler/" title="tabview: csv files have never been cooler" target="_blank">tabview</a> or <a href="https://inconsolation.wordpress.com/2013/10/04/csvkit-lots-of-little-tools-in-a-pack/" title="csvkit: Lots of little tools, in a pack" target="_blank">other tools</a> can do.</p>
<p>For my own recordkeeping, Dead Guy CLI gets points for doing something obvious that I don’t recall seeing elsewhere. And also for the snarky name. I’m a fan of snarky names. <span class="wp-smiley wp-emoji wp-emoji-twisted" title=":twisted:">:twisted:</span></p><br> Tagged: <a href="https://inconsolation.wordpress.com/tag/ascii/">ascii</a>, <a href="https://inconsolation.wordpress.com/tag/change/">change</a>, <a href="https://inconsolation.wordpress.com/tag/chart/">chart</a>, <a href="https://inconsolation.wordpress.com/tag/convert/">convert</a>, <a href="https://inconsolation.wordpress.com/tag/csv/">csv</a>, <a href="https://inconsolation.wordpress.com/tag/data/">data</a>, <a href="https://inconsolation.wordpress.com/tag/excel/">excel</a>, <a href="https://inconsolation.wordpress.com/tag/file/">file</a>, <a href="https://inconsolation.wordpress.com/tag/spreadsheet/">spreadsheet</a>, <a href="https://inconsolation.wordpress.com/tag/xls/">xls</a> <img border="0" src="https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=inconsolation.wordpress.com&amp;blog=43062292&amp;post=9685&amp;subd=inconsolation&amp;ref=&amp;feed=1" width="1" height="1">

              <p>Everyone named “Greg” out there in the world can now sit up straight and imagine <a href="https://github.com/manolomartinez/greg" target="_blank">this little program</a> is named in their honor.</p>
<p><a href="https://inconsolation.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/2015-04-21-6m47421-greg.png"><img src="https://inconsolation.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/2015-04-21-6m47421-greg.png?w=150&amp;h=91" alt="2015-04-21-6m47421-greg" width="150" height="91" class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-9683"></a></p>
<p>I was introduced to greg after yesterday’s note about <a href="https://inconsolation.wordpress.com/2015/04/20/podcastxdl-one-shot-downloads-for-your-ears/" title="podcastxdl: One-shot downloads for your ears" target="_blank">podcastxdl</a>, and in spite of its lack of color and command-action-target input style, I think I like it better than the latter.</p>
<p>Of course, that screenshot isn’t very interesting, but what you see there is a lot of the way greg works. It maintains a list of podcasts and addresses, and you can wrangle them with fairly straightforward actions.</p>
<p><code>greg add</code> adds to that list. <code>greg remove</code> drops it off, after you confirm it. <code>greg check</code> sees if anything is updated, and <code>greg sync</code> synchronizes your local folder with what’s available online. Like I said, it’s fairly straightforward.</p>
<p>I don’t see anything offhand that disappoints me about greg. I ran into no errors except when I fed it an invalid link, and it warned me that it wasn’t going to work. And aside from the lack of color and lack of an “interface,” it seems to work perfectly without my empty-headed suggestions.</p>
<p>So there’s greg, which we can add to the meager list of podcast aggregators for the console. Now do you see it? “greg”? “ag<strong>greg</strong>ator”? Aha. … <span class="wp-smiley wp-emoji wp-emoji-wink" title=";)">;)</span></p><br> Tagged: <a href="https://inconsolation.wordpress.com/tag/audio/">audio</a>, <a href="https://inconsolation.wordpress.com/tag/download/">download</a>, <a href="https://inconsolation.wordpress.com/tag/manager/">manager</a>, <a href="https://inconsolation.wordpress.com/tag/player/">player</a>, <a href="https://inconsolation.wordpress.com/tag/podcast/">podcast</a> <img border="0" src="https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=inconsolation.wordpress.com&amp;blog=43062292&amp;post=9682&amp;subd=inconsolation&amp;ref=&amp;feed=1" width="1" height="1">

  <a href="//what-if.xkcd.com/136/"><h1>Spiders vs. the Sun</h1></a>
  <p id="question">Which has a greater gravitational pull on me: the Sun, or spiders? Granted, the Sun is much bigger, but it is also much further away, and as I learned in high school physics, the gravitational force is proportional to the square of the distance.</p>
<p id="attribute">—Marina Fleming</p>
<p><em>Note: This is a spider-heavy article. I can be a little anxious about spiders myself, so my research for this article involved a lot of opening PDFs while squinting and leaning back from the screen. If you're a serious arachnophobe, you might want to skip this one.</em></p>
<p>In the literal sense, this question is totally reasonable, although it would be easy to rephrase it to be completely incoherent.</p>
<img class="illustration" title="Is the Sun heavier than spiders in terms of closeness?" src="/imgs/a/136/question.png">
<p>The gravitational pull from a <em>single</em> spider, no matter how heavy, will never beat out the Sun. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goliath_birdeater">goliath bird-eating spider</a><span class="ref"><span class="refnum">[1]</span><span class="refbody">Wikipedia helpfully notes that despite its name, it "only rarely preys on birds, with the exception of young birds."</span></span> weighs as much as a large apple.<span class="ref"><span class="refnum">[2]</span><span class="refbody">This is correct whether I mean the fruit or the iPhone 6+; the spider weighs about as much as each.</span></span> Even if, God forbid, you were as close as possible to one of them, the pull from the Sun would still be 50 million times stronger.</p>
<img class="illustration" title="The strength of the force seems to vary inversely with distance, although with some kind of lag; once I start running, I don't want to stop for a little while." src="/imgs/a/136/force.png">
<p>What about <em>all</em> the spiders in the world?</p>
<p>There's a well-known factoid that claims you're always within a few feet of a spider. Is this true? Arachnologist<span class="ref"><span class="refnum">[3]</span><span class="refbody">Spiders, not ancient pottery.</span></span>​<span class="ref"><span class="refnum">[4]</span><span class="refbody">Unless the ancient pottery is full of spiders.</span></span> Chris Buddle wrote a <a href="http://arthropodecology.com/2012/06/05/you-are-always-within-three-feet-of-a-spider-fact-or-fiction/">good article</a> on this question; as you might expect, it's not literally true. Spiders don't live in the water,<span class="ref"><span class="refnum">[5]</span><span class="refbody">With the exception of <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diving_bell_spider">Argyroneta aquatica</a></em></span></span> so you can get away from them by swimming, and there aren't as many spiders in buildings as in fields and forests. But if you're anywhere near the outdoors, even in the Arctic tundra, there are probably spiders within a few feet of you.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether the factoid is precisely true or not, there are an awful lot of spiders out there. Exactly how many is hard to say, but we can do some rough estimation. A <a href="http://www.bioone.org/doi/pdf/10.1636/T08-21.1">2009 study</a> actually measured the total mass of spiders in sample areas in Brazil. They found one-digit numbers of milligrams of spider<span class="ref"><span class="refnum">[6]</span><span class="refbody">SI unit: the "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA", abbreviated "AAAAAA".</span></span> per square meter of forest floor.<span class="ref"><span class="refnum">[7]</span><span class="refbody">That's dry mass; you have to divide by a number around 0.3 to get the live weight.</span></span> If we guess that about 10% of the world's land area hosts this density of spiders, and there are none anywhere else, we come up with 200 million kilograms worldwide.<span class="ref"><span class="refnum">[8]</span><span class="refbody"><a href="http://newzealandecology.org/nzje/2020">One survey</a> of fields and pastures in New Zealand and England tended to find two-digit numbers of spiders per square meter. If they each weigh about a milligram, and we assume once again that about 10% of Earth's land supports that density of spiders, that gives a total spider biomass of 100 million to a billion kilograms. That agrees with our first estimate, at least.</span></span></p>
<p>Even if our numbers are off wildly, it's enough to answer Marina's question. If we assume the spiders are distributed evenly across the surface of the Earth, we can use Newton's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_theorem">shell theorem</a> to determine their collective gravitational pull on objects outside the Earth. If you do that math, you find that the Sun's pull is stronger by <em>13 orders of magnitude</em>.</p>
<p>Now, this calculation makes some assumptions that aren't true. Spider distributions are discrete, not continuous,<span class="ref"><span class="refnum">[9]</span><span class="refbody">Spiders are quantized.</span></span> and some areas have more spiders than others. What if there happen to be a <em>lot</em> of spiders near you?</p>
<img class="illustration" title="Although three spider feet is only 9 inches." src="/imgs/a/136/feet.png">
<p>In 2009, the Back River Wastewater Treatment Plant found themselves dealing with what they called an "extreme spider situation." An estimated 80 million orb-weaving spiders had colonized the plant, covering every surface with heavy sheets of web.<span class="ref"><span class="refnum">[10]</span><span class="refbody">Which was in turn covered in heavy sheets of spider.</span></span> The whole thing is detailed in a <a href="http://www.entsoc.org/PDF/2010/Orb-weaving-spiders.pdf">fascinating and horrifying article</a> published by the Entomological Society of America.<span class="ref"><span class="refnum">[12]</span><span class="refbody">The conclusion of the article contains this breathtaking piece of prose:<br><br><em>  Our recommendations for amelioration included the following general points:<br>  <strong>1)</strong> On-site personnel should be reassured that the spiders are harmless and the facility's immense shroud of silk should be presented in a positive light as a record-breaking natural history wonder.</em></span></span></p>
<p>What was the total force of gravity from all those spiders? First we need their mass; according to a paper titled <em><a href="http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/2462552?uid=3739808&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;uid=3739256&amp;sid=21105973527841">Sexual Cannibalism in Orb-Weaving Spiders: An Economic Model</a></em>, it's about 20 grams for males and several times that for females.<span class="ref"><span class="refnum">[11]</span><span class="refbody">Not to be confused with <em><a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00265-011-1269-0">Trade-off between pre- and postcopulatory sexual cannibalism in a wolf spider</a></em>, which is a different but equally real paper.</span></span> So even if you were standing next to the Black River Wastewater Treatment Plant in 2009, the pull of all the spiders inside would still be only 1/50,000,000th that of the Sun.</p>
<p>No matter which way you look at it, the bottom line is that we live our lives surrounded by tiny spiders on a world completely dominated by a gigantic star.</p>
<p>Hey, at least it's not the other way around.</p>

  <a href="//what-if.xkcd.com/135/"><h1>Digging Downward</h1></a>
  <p id="question">What would happen if I dug straight down, at a speed of 1 foot per second? What would kill me first?</p>
<p id="attribute">Jack Kaunis</p>
<p>This question is the reverse of <a href="http://what-if.xkcd.com/64/">question #64</a>, which asked how you'd die if you <em>rose</em> steadily at a foot per second. Digging at the same rate would kill you more quickly.</p>
<img class="illustration" title="However long it takes you to reach a body of water or a cliff or a mountain lion, I guess." src="/imgs/a/135/kill.png">
<p>After you get through the surface layers,<span class="ref"><span class="refnum">[1]</span><span class="refbody">See <a href="http://what-if.xkcd.com/132/">question #132</a> for more on that.</span></span> temperatures rise pretty steadily as you go deeper, a trend that continues all the way to the core.</p>
<p>In some areas, where the hot magma<span class="ref"><span class="refnum">[2]</span><span class="refbody">(<a href="http://xkcd.com/1405/">Lava</a>.)</span></span> is closer to the surface, the ground gets hotter more quickly.</p>
<p>The Southern Methodist University Geothermal Lab has produced some <a href="http://www.smu.edu/Dedman/Academics/Programs/GeothermalLab/DataMaps/TemperatureMaps">superb maps</a> showing the temperature of deep rocks in different parts of the United States. If you look at <a href="http://www.smu.edu/~/media/Site/Dedman/Academics/Programs/Geothermal%20Lab/Graphics/TemperatureMaps/SMU_2011_35kmTemperature.ashx?la=en">the map of the 3.5 km layer</a>, you see that at that depth, most of the US is colored greenish-yellow, representing temperatures somewhere around 100°C—with one glaring exception. In northwest Wyoming, there's a circle of ground colored bright red, where the rock is much hotter than normal. That circle is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellowstone_Caldera">Yellowstone supervolcano</a>.</p>
<img class="illustration" title="For the record, although people find it exciting to speculate otherwise, there's no reason to expect it to erupt any time soon, in human terms." src="/imgs/a/135/what.png">
<p>The SMU maps show that even if you avoided digging in Yellowstone, you'd quickly encounter temperatures too hot for an unprotected human. The ground typically gets hotter at an average of about 35°C per kilometer, so at a rate of a foot per second, you'd encounter lethal heat within an hour or two.</p>
<p>But wait a moment.</p>
<p>Let's say your hole is about a meter wide. At the rate you're digging, you have to remove roughly half a ton of material every second.</p>
<p>No human would be capable of lifting that <em>first</em> foot of material out of the hole so quickly, and it only gets worse after that. After a minute of digging, you'd be 60 feet down, and would have to lift all that rock and dirt a huge distance vertically to get it out of the hole. The power required to do that lifting—just after the first minute—would be roughly 150 horsepower.</p>
<img class="illustration" title="You can lead a horse to a meter-wide hole, but you can't make it and 149 more horses jump in every minute." src="/imgs/a/135/horse.png">
<p>Even if you're not doing the lifting yourself, the way your question is worded makes it pretty clear that <em>you</em> are in this hole. Whatever process you're using is going to require huge amounts of energy to lift all that rock, and that energy is inevitably going to result in the hole being heated somehow. Even if the layer you're digging through wasn't hot when you started, it will be.</p>
<p>What if we assume you're protected against the heat from the ground (and the digging mechanism)? Well, in that case, the pressure would become a problem. As you go deeper, air pressure increases. Below about 5 km, the pressure is high enough that <a href="http://www.scuba-doc.com/oxygentox.html">oxygen</a> becomes <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOZuxwVk7TU">toxic</a>.</p>
<p>So what if you're protected against the heat, pressure, <em>and</em> the digging process?</p>
<p>Well, at that point, we've redefined the rules so much that I'm not sure it makes sense to try to calculate an answer. The question—"what would kill you if you kept digging downward"—has left the realm of physics and become fantasy.</p>
<p>Which, come to think of it, makes the answer perfectly clear.</p>

              <p>I have not bothered updating my Linux kernel package here since my VPS provider – <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/">Digital Ocean</a> – went crazy and <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/questions/arch-being-deprecated-by-do">deprecated</a> Arch Linux as an install option.  That is obviously a bad thing…</p>
<p>This backfired on me today.  It turns out that <tt>systemd-218</tt> does not like an old i686 kernels (I had 3.13.7) and I could not log in.  I am not the only one to notice <a href="https://bugs.archlinux.org/task/43625">this</a>, so there may be a genuine bug there.  It also seems that DO recovery console is a bit useless if you have a problem other than a network issue.  Good thing I have DO system backups set to run every week (in a completely unrelated incident…  I think one comment on one of my posts got lost and restoring from my more regular WordPress backup is too much effort).</p>
<p>So how to run a newer kernel – I have no idea what DO do in the background, but your installed kernel needs to match the one you select in the DO control panel. I think the kernel and initrd are stored externally and if this does not match the installed version, your system’s modules fail to load. This is how I know the rescue console is good when networking fails!</p>
<p>Kexec to the rescue! You can do a fancy systemd type thing (see Arch wiki <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Kexec">page</a>), but I just provided a script in <tt>/usr/bin/init</tt>.  To do this, install <tt>kexec-tools</tt> and remove <tt>systemd-sysvcompat</tt>.  Then paste this into <tt>/usr/bin/init</tt>:</p>
<p><code>#!/bin/sh<br>
 <br>
kexec --load /boot/vmlinuz-linux --initrd=/boot/initramfs-linux.img --append="root=LABEL=DOROOT init=/usr/lib/systemd/systemd" &amp;&amp;<br>
mount -o ro,remount / &amp;&amp;<br>
kexec -e<br>
 <br>
exec /usr/lib/systemd/systemd</code><br>
Give that file <tt>755</tt> permissions, and all is done.</p>
<p>Now if all that does not put you off, and you really want to install Arch Linux on DO, here is a script that <a href="https://github.com/gh2o/digitalocean-debian-to-arch">coverts</a> a Debain droplet to an Arch one!  You can also use my referral <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=6338b1468823">link</a>…</p>
<p>Edit: when checking this article before posting I found <a href="https://digitalocean.uservoice.com/users/36857687-andrew-sparks">this</a> and <a href="https://github.com/helirexi/LEMP-VPS-DigitalOcean">this</a>.  I’m not as clever as I thought, or these people are at least equally clever.</p>

<p>Hi Allan,<br>
<b>I’d like to say you are moron</b> if you were thinking that commiting 61ba5c961e4a3536c4bbf41edb348987a9993fdb to pacman was good idea!<br>
I am Arch Linux user becouse it allows me to do virtually anything so I manage some of my arch-based servers from root account. I also have netbook with root account only for my own reasons. And you’ve destroyed not only my routine but also several programs that were depending on that. Screw you with reverting package version or using patch from aur – it’s supposed to work out-of-the-box even on Arch.</p>
<p>No greetings,<br>
Daniel Skowroński</p>
<p>PS. You could have at least let anybody else sign-off that imbecile commit…</p>
